    No auth token, because BMONI cannot hold one. Authenticity comes from the

    `x-webhook-signature`, keyed with our subscription's secret
    (`BMONI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). The body is therefore verified BEFORE it is
    parsed — re-serialising JSON first would change the bytes and break the
    check. An unsigned or wrongly-signed delivery is a `400`, exactly as the
    Paystack webhook treats its own.

    BMONI retries deliveries, so `x-webhook-event-id` is the dedupe key: the
    event is stored once (`event_id` is unique) and a repeat is a no-op `200`
    rather than a second row. What gets stored is what BMONI actually said.

    Phase 1 archives events without crediting them, so they land
    `processed=False` as the Phase 2 worklist — crediting a deposit needs our
